MiGrid: User Guides
===================

|docs|

`MiGrid User Guides`_ hosts documentation and user guides for the ERDA and SIF MiGrid sites at UCPH.

We use the `Read the Docs`_ documentation hosting platform and use `Sphinx`_ documents written with `reStructuredText`_, which is built by pulling from this repository.
