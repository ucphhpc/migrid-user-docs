Schedule Tasks
==============

It is possible to have ERDA do a number of tasks on your behalf with the **Schedule Tasks** functionality.
The corresponding navigation menu entry is not shown by default to keep it simple, but you can **Add** it to your home page, which you can read more about on <erda-homepage-start>`.

On the **Schedule Tasks** page you can schedule one-time or regularly repeat tasks, such as inserting a task to create a new backup archive every day with the contents of some folder on ERDA.

You can follow scheduled runs in the **View Logs** tab.
You can also read more about the automatic variables and available commands at the bottom of the **Manage Tasks** tab on the **Schedule Tasks** page.
