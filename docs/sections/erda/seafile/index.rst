ERDA Seafile
============

ERDA Seafile is a file/folder synchronisation and data sharing service similar to Dropbox/OneDrive/Google Drive/iCloud - But with the advantage that your data are stored internally and securely at UCPH.


.. _erda-seafile-gettingstarted:
Getting Started with Seafile
============================

In order to use Seafile, you need to log onto ERDA. Once on the user homepage, click the green avatar icon in the bottom left corner, and click "Setup".


Click on the "Seafile" tab, and create a new password for your Seafile. The password must consist of at least eight characters and must contain a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits and special characters (at least three of the four types mentioned). Confirm the password once more and click "Register".

Once you have completed registration, ERDA administrators will be notified and will activate your Seafile account, and you will receive an email when your account is ready.

When it is ready, navigate back to the Seafile Setup page and click on the "log in" button under Login and Install, or click on the link in the email directly.

Once on the Seafile login page, you just need to enter your email address and your newly chosen password for your Seafile account, before pressing "Log In".


.. _erda-seafile-about:
About libraries
===============

Seafile organises your folders and files in "Libraries". This is a logical collection of folders and files that makes them easier to manage and optionally share with others. You can create a new library by clicking "New Library" before being prompted to write a descriptive title before you can finally click "Submit". In this prompt, you can choose to tick "Encrypt" and create a separate encryption password, and the data within will automatically be encrypted before being saved centrally.

In your new library, you can manually upload files and folders that you want to synchronise or share by clicking "Upload" and selecting said files and folders.

You can also install the Seafile client and use it to enter data automatically from your computer, as we will discuss in the next section.


.. _erda-seafile-install:
Seafile Client
==============

Install Seafile Client
----------------------

To synchronise Seafile Library data with your computer, you can download and install the Seafile client. This can be installed on as many computers as you like. You can find a link to `Seafile Client <https://www.seafile.com/en/download/>`_ either on the bottom of the Seafile page, or by clicking on the link in this section. On the page, click on the client that is relevant for you.


Tips for installation on a UCPH computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a standard UCPH computer (B machine), you have access to installing programs by clicking "Request administrator access" in the bottom right-hand corner, unless you are on a special, secure UCPH computer (A machine). If that is the case, you may contact UCPH IT to install the necessary programs.


.. _erda-seafile-setup:
Set up Seafile Client
---------------------

During the installation process, you will be requested to "Add an account", where, among other information, you must fill in the field "Server" and "Username", which you can find on your Seafile Setup page on the :ref:`erda-homepage-start`.

On the SEtup page, you need to click "proceed" with the client set up and it will give you your personal server address and username. Copy what the instructions state in the fields "Server" and "Username", and insert the information in the respective fields in the below pop-up window with "Add an Account" on the Seafile Client.

Once the client has been installed, you will find a small Seafile icon in your system tray.


.. _erda-seafile-synch:
Synchronise Files
-----------------

In order to synchronise files, you can click on the orange icon in your system tray to open and manage your Seafile client.

Right-click your Seafile client in the library you want to synchronise. In the example below, a library has been set up with the title "Project e-infrastructure", and you must click the "Sync this library" button to make it manually synchronise.

.. image:: /images/seafile/seafile-sync.png

You may be prompted to select which path on your hard drive to synchronise to. Choose this before clicking "OK".

.. INFO::
   When the synchronisation of a library is initiated, the cloud icon will change to show the progress, and the cloud will turn green once the process is complete. This is also visible from within the Seafile client.
