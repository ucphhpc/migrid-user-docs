Two-factor Authentication
=========================

.. Security::
   To increase security, we recommend that you use two-factor authentication for all ERDA access.

   
With two-factor authentication, you can add an extra verification step to the login process which authenticates you. In addition to asking about something you know (in this case your username and password), an account protected by two-factor authentication will also request a token from an app you have on either your phone, tablet or desktop.


Setup
-----

When setting up two-factor authentication, you must complete a one-time wizard.

Click the green avatar in the bottom left corner. Click "Setup".
