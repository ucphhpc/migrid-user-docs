Two-factor Authentication
=========================

.. Security::
   To increase security, we recommend that you use two-factor authentication for all ERDA access.

   
With two-factor authentication, you can add an extra verification step to the login process which authenticates you. In addition to asking about something you know (in this case your username and password), an account protected by two-factor authentication will also request a token from an app you have on either your phone, tablet or desktop.


Setup
-----

When setting up two-factor authentication, you must complete a one-time wizard.

Click the green avatar in the bottom left corner. Click "Setup".

Click on the button "Okay, let's go!"

A wizard will now appear in ERDA which you must follow, either via its text in the wizard or by following along here.


Download App
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to install a TOTP Authenticator client on either a phone or tablet, like `Google Authenticator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>`_, `FreeOTP <https://freeotp.github.io/>`_, `Yubico Authenticator <https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/#h-download-yubico-authenticator>`_, `Bitwarden <https://bitwarden.com/download/>`_ or `NetIQ Advanced Authentication <https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/cyberres/identity-access-management/advanced-authentication>`_. Find any of these where you normally download apps, and click "I've got it installed!".
