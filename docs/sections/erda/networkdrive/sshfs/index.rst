SSHFS
=====

SSHFS is a kind of network drive which is supported on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux. SSHFS uses SSH/SFTP connections underneath, so it inherits a number of the advantages like efficiencty plus network robustness from there, and is supported directly with ERDA SFTP.

Below, you can find user guides on how to setup SSHFS with SFTP for both Windows and MacOS. If you are interested in a file synchronisation service resembling Dropbox, but which you are permitted to use as a KU Employee, then you can also check out Seafile, also linked below.
