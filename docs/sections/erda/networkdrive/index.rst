Connect ERDA as a Network Drive
===============================

If you are an ERDA user, you can work locally on your computer with your ERDA files by connecting ERDA as a network drive.
When you make changes to the files via the network drive, the changes are applied directly to the files in ERDA.

Network drive access uses a secure connection, and the files are available wherever you are, as long as you have internet access.
This means that you do *not* need a VPN to work with the files outside UCPH.

You have two options for connecting ERDA as network drives:
