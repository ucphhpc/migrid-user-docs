Jupyter
=======

ERDA integrates a set of `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ services, which can be used to easily perform a wide range of data analysis and visualization tasks directly on your ERDA data. We rely on the `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ web interface to provide interactive and flexible *notebooks* with direct and efficient access to your ERDA home directory. In the notebooks you can use various programming languages like `Python` or `R` to explore, analyze or present your data, e.g. for your own research, for interactive presentations or even for teaching purposes.

To get access to these services, click the **Jupyter** button in the navigation menu on the ERDA homepage. Upon clicking it, you are presented with a page where you can select either DAG or MODI.
