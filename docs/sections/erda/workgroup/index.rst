Workgroups (ERDA)
=================

As a UCPH employee, you can set up and administrate workgroups in ERDA (:ref:`erda-workgroup-creator`).
They include a shared folder in which you can easily share files and collaborate with others from UCPH
and/or external collaboration partners. You can manage who has access, and there are no special restrictions
on size or file types. All persons affiliated to UCPH as well as external partners can request access to a work group
on ERDA (:ref:`erda-workgroup-requestor`). You can also see how to work in a workgroup in our :ref:`erda-workgroup-work` section.

.. Note::
   This guide assumes that you have registered with ERDA and are logged in (see :ref:`erda-signup-start`).

Create and administrate workgroup
---------------------------------

Click "Workgroups" on the front page of ERDA.

.. image:: /images/workgroups/workgroups-clickstart.png

Under "*Workgroups managed on this server*", you will see all existing workgroups.
Next to each workgroup, there are several icons on which you can click. The icons vary depending
on whether you are a owner, member, or can simply observe an existing workgroup. By holding the mouse
marker over the icon, you can see what the icon means.

An overview of each icon:

Create workgroup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a new workgroup under "*Additional Workgroups*" at the bottom of the page.
Write a short and apt title in the field, before clicking "*Create Workgroup*".

Your new workgroup is then created with the title name, and you will enter a new page.
From here, you can click the link "*Administration for [name of your workgroup]*".

Clicking on the link leads you to the administrator page for your new workgroup

.. image:: /images/workgroups/workgroups-administratorpage.png

There you can invite co-owners or members to join your workgroup if you know their ERDA ID or the email
with which they are registered.

As it may be difficult to know under which ID/email a user has been created, we recommend that you instead
ask your internal or external collaboration partners to request membership themselves by clicking the "*Request membership*"
icon (See :ref:`erda-workgroup-requestor` for more information).

We recommend that you ensure that there are at least two owners of your workgroup so that someone preserves access control in
case either of you leave UCPH.


Accept request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an intrernal or external collaboration partner requests to become a member of your workgroup, you will receive an email.

Click the first link in that email below the line "*If you want to handle the member request please visit:*" which will take
you to the administrator page, where you find the membership request under "*Pending Requests*".

Click on the plus icon next to "*Member*", and click "*Yes*" in the pop-up window "*Confirm*" to accept the request.

You may write a short message to the person who has requested membership. Click "*Inform user(s)*".

Your collaboration partner will now receive an email with the above message about access to your workgroup, and your short message
should you have chosen to include one.
