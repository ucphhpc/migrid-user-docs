ERDA Homepage
=============

On your Home page you can navigate between the available ERDA Apps and modify which apps to enable in your web interface.

It makes accessing the different parts of ERDA easy, and is made so that you can customize it to include what you want to see.

Add and remove apps

*Home*, *Files*, *Workgroups*, *Archives* and *Jupyter* will always be on the frontpage and in the sidebar, but by clicking on the **Add** button, one can select and deselect ERDA's other apps to be shown on the front page and in the left sidebar.
After selecting all the apps you want to see, you can go down to the bottom of the page and click on the **Save** button, before clicking on the **x** in the top-right corner.
