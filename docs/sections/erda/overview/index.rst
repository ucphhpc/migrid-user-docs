ERDA and ERDA Seafile Overview
################################

The Electronic Research Data Archive (ERDA) at SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen provides two separate areas for storing and sharing data:

1. ERDA Main Storage
2. ERDA Seafile

Key Advantages
--------------

* Data stored internally at UCPH
* Secure data transfer over encrypted connections
* Two-factor authentication support
* Dynamic sharing via Workgroups/groups
* Share links for external recipients (no account required)

   * - ERDA Main Storage
     - ERDA Seafile
   * - Up to 10 TB, ask us for more space
     - 100 GB fixed limit
   * - Only manual data synchronisation
     - | Automatic synchronisation of data
       | between your computer and ERDA Seafile
   * - No file history/rewind
     - | Automatic history for all files,
       | including rewind function
   * - Only manual encryption for data in storage
     - | Can automatically encrypt data locally,
