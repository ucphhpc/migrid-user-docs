How much storage space do I have on ERDA?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's no space quota as such on the general ERDA storage, but the huge data sets known from high energy physics and bioinformatic databases are examples of data contents not considered suitable for ERDA. Anything within a few tens of terabytes should be fine, and we suggest that you just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.
ERDA also includes a file synchronization service called Seafile, and that particular part may not be so suitable for big data sets, so it comes with a quota of 100 GB per user.
