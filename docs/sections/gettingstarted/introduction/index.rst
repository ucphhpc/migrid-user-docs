Getting Started
===============

`ERDA <https://erda.ku.dk/>`_ and `SIF <https://sif.ku.dk/>`_ are two services for storing, sharing, and analyzing research data.
ERDA is intended for general scientific data, while SIF is intended for highly sensitive data.


The services are provided by SCIENCE at |lorg|.


This page is designed to help you get started with using |migrid| and |smigrid|. We have gathered information about both systems and their supported software,
with links to our written resources.
