Getting Started
===============

`ERDA <https://erda.ku.dk/>`_ and `SIF <https://sif.ku.dk/>`_ are two services provided by the University of Copenhagen
for storing, sharing, and analyzing research data. ERDA is intended for general scientific data, while SIF is intended for highly sensitive data.


This page is designed to help you get started with using ERDA and SIF. We have gathered information about both systems and their supported software,
with links to our written resources.
