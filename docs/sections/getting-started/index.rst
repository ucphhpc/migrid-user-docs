Getting Started
===============

We've gathered information about ERDA in a few short intro guides and a more thorough user guide

Sign Up Intro for UCPH and external users
Workgroup Intro about creating, managing and accessing Workgroups
Network Drive Intro about using ERDA as a network drive on your computer (only covers Windows for now)
Seafile Intro about Seafile sign up and file synchronization
Seafile Collaboration Intro about Seafile data sharing and exchange
ERDA Overview if you're not sure whether to use ERDA's main storage or Seafile
User Guide with general usage instructions
We strongly recommend reading and following at least the first intro guide if you want to use ERDA.
