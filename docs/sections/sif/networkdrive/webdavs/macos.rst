Setup WebDAVS on MacOS
======================

.. _sif-networkdrive-mdavssetup:

Setup WebDAVS via Finder
------------------------

On MacOS you can access remote WebDAVS content with the built-in file manager, Finder.
In the menu under **Go** you select **Connect to Server**.


Enter the server URL from the **WebDAVS** setup tab and click **Connect**.

You will then be prompted for your automatic username and the password you entered.
The automated username will be *yourmail@projectName* and can be seen in the **Setup** tab.

On success you will see the remote contents under the **SHARED** section of Finder.

Disconnect Network Drive
------------------------

You can disconnect SIF as a network drive, and we recommend this if you share a computer with others or simply if you believe that your connection will drop (if you close the lid on a laptop, let a computer enter sleep-mode etc.) as you will receive a friendly mail telling you about this, which can be disruptive. This will also happen when your SIF session on the connected computer runs out, so we recommend that anyone disconnects after finishing their work session, as they can easily connect again next time they need it.

Right click on the drive, and click on 'Eject "io.erda.dk"'. If it complains about being in use, you can drag it to the trashbin, where it will disconnect.
