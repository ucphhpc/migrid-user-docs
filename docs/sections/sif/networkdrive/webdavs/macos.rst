Setup WebDAVS via Finder
------------------------

On MacOS you can access remote WebDAVS content with the built-in file manager, Finder.
In the menu under **Go** you select **Connect to Server**.


Enter the server URL from the **WebDAVS** setup tab and click **Connect**.

You will then be prompted for your automatic username and the password you entered.
The automated username will be *yourmail@projectName* and can be seen in the **Setup** tab.

On success you will see the remote contents under the **SHARED** section of Finder.
