Setup WebDAVS on Linux
======================

As the nature of Linux is about free choice, we can make no assumptions on what you have available.
Instead, this page will detail what most modern Linux distributions offer in terms of native file manager.
Be it Nautilus, Konqueror, Dolphin, Thunar or something else.

Linux File Manager
------------------

In the file manager menu typically under **Go** you select **Open Location**.

Enter the server URL from the **WebDAVS** setup tab (possibly replacing *https* with *davs* in the URL if it complains) and click **Connect**.

In XFCE with the Thunar file manager you need to use the *davs* rather than the *https* prefix in the URL.


You will then be prompted for your automatic username and the password you entered on the **WebDAVS** setup tab.
In this case it specified the atuomatic username *yoursifmail@projectName*.


On success you will see the remote content.
