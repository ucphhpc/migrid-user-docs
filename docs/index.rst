About ERDA
==========

ERDA (Electronic Research Data Archive) at the University of Copenhagen (KU/UCPH) is meant for storing, sharing, analyzing and archiving research data.
The intended audience is KU/UCPH employees, their collaboration partners and students. ERDA delivers safe central storage space for own and shared files, interactive analysis tools in addition to archiving for safe-keeping and publishing. You can use ERDA as a secure network drive from anywhere and it also comes with a stand-alone file synchronization service similar to Dropbox, but with the data safely stored locally at UCPH.
ERDA is delivered by `SCIENCE HPC Center <https://science.ku.dk/english/research/research-e-infrastructure/science-hpc-centre/>`_ and is formally for the faculty of Science, but others have access mainly for data archiving and publication with UCPH DOIs. A roll-out to all of UCPH is underway to support the general UCPH `Data Management Guidelines <https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx>`_. 


Sensitive and Personal Data (GDPR)
==================================

Please note that while ERDA comes with a strong security focus, it is only a solution approved for general scientific data and not for highly sensitive data. In particular it is not for personal data classified as sensitive in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In case you need to work on such sensitive data we recommend the ERDA sister facility `SIF <https://sif.ku.dk/>`_, which is intended and approved for exactly that purpose. SIF offers a number of additional security features and functionality that are specifically designed to protect sensitive data.


Status and News
===============

You can always refer to our separate `status and news overview <https://status.erda.dk/status.html>`_ for all of the latest ERDA and SIF system status as well as information about new or changed features. For this site, it is possible to check build status `here <https://readthedocs.org/projects/migrid-user-docs/builds/>`_.


Questions and Support
=====================

Feel free to contact us using the email `support@erda.dk <mailto:support@erda.dk>`_ for ERDA support or `support@sif.erda.dk <mailto:support@sif.erda.dk>`_ for SIF support in case you have any questions or comments (in English or Danish) not covered by this page. Unfortunately we do not have resources to offer video or phone support, but we typically reply on email within two working days at the latest, and often faster.

Please report any security breaches or vulnerabilities on ERDA as described in `security.txt <https://sif.ku.dk/.well-known/security.txt>`_.
