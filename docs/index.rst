.. Note::
   This documentation is WIP! We are currently focused on updating our ERDA-related resources.

Welcome to the ERDA/SIF documentation site. `ERDA <https://erda.ku.dk/>`_ and `SIF <https://sif.ku.dk/>`_ simplifies storing, sharing, analyzing and archiving research data for KU/UCPH employees, their collaboration partners, and KU/UCPH students.

To quickly get started with ERDA and/or SIF, we recommend our :ref:`getting-started` page. If you are looking for something specific, the search functionality and the sidebar on the left is a good way to find what you are looking for!

|:file_cabinet:| About ERDA
    ERDA (Electronic Research Data Archive) at the University of Copenhagen (KU/UCPH) is meant for storing,
    sharing, analyzing and archiving research data. ERDA delivers safe central storage space for ones own
    and shared files, interactive analysis tools in addition to archiving for safe-keeping and publishing.

    You can use ERDA as a secure network drive from anywhere and it also comes with a stand-alone file
    synchronisation service similar to Dropbox, but with the data safely stored locally at UCPH.
    ERDA is delivered by `SCIENCE HPC Center <https://science.ku.dk/english/research/research-e-infrastructure/science-hpc-centre/>`_
    and is formally for the faculty of Science, but others have access mainly for data archiving and
    publication with UCPH DOIs. A roll-out to all of UCPH is underway to support the general UCPH `Data Management Guidelines <https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx>`_.

|:shield:| Sensitive and Personal Data (GDPR)
    Please note that while ERDA comes with a strong security focus, it is only a solution approved for
    general scientific data and not for highly sensitive data. In particular it is not for personal data
    classified as sensitive in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In case you need to work
    on such sensitive data we recommend the ERDA sister facility `SIF <https://sif.ku.dk/>`_, which is intended
    and approved for exactly that purpose. SIF offers a number of additional security features and functionality
    that are specifically designed to protect sensitive data.

|:closed_lock_with_key:| About SIF
    SIF (Sensitive Information Facility) at University of Copenhagen (KU/UCPH) is meant for storing
    and sharing sensitive data. In particular personal data requiring special care under the
    EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The intended audience is employees, their collaboration partners
    and students. SIF delivers secure centralized storage space for various projects involving sensitive data and
    integrates safe sharing with other internal or external project participants as well as network drive use from
    anywhere.
    SIF is delivered by `SCIENCE HPC Center <https://science.ku.dk/english/research/research-e-infrastructure/science-hpc-centre/>`_
    and is formally for the faculty of Science, but others have access mainly for data archiving and
    publication with UCPH DOIs. A roll-out to all of UCPH is underway to support the general UCPH `Data Management Guidelines <https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx>`_.
